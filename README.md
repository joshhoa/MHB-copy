# MHB
A project I collaborated with to connect players from Monster Hunter Rise. It enable hem to build loadouts, get the combined stats and share them to the community.

### Front folder
```bash
cd Monster-hunter-Builder-Front

# start the front app
yarn dev

# Access on http://localhost:5173/
```

### Back folder
```bash
cd Monster-hunter-Builder-Back

# Can start the API with the following command
node index.js

# But prefer nodemon
nodemon index.js

# Runs on http://localhost:3000/
```
